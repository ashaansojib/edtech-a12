                Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our daily lives, often without us even realizing it. It's behind the voice assistants that respond to our queries, the recommendation systems that suggest movies and products, and even the virtual chatbots that provide customer support. Harnessing AI's power begins with understanding its applications and implications.
                AI extends far beyond consumer technology. Businesses, large and small, leverage AI to analyze vast datasets, automate routine tasks, and gain valuable insights. Learning how AI can help organizations solve problems, enhance decision-making processes, and boost productivity is a significant step toward utilizing its power.
